<h1>Speed is all we've got.</h1>

<hr />

<h2>Your decisions are only as good as your information</h2>

<p>When you wait too long to launch, you only learn a bit and by then it's too late.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Launch fast and improve in cycles</h1>

<p>When you launch the fastest thing you can, again and again, you learn what's important and have more time to try again.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Optimise for fast decisions</h1>

<p>--</p>

<p>When we're wrong, we'll also correct quickly.</p>

<hr />

<p>A man wakes up,</p>

<p>turns on the radio,</p>

<p>walks upstairs,</p>

<p>turns on the light, </p>

<p>and kills himself.</p>

<h2>## Why?</h2>

<p>To learn faster and better, it helps to know <em>what type</em> of learning you're doing.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Three types of learning</h1>

<p>[Experiment]
[Investigate]
[Observe]</p>

<hr />

<h1>The same with Science</h1>

<p>[Experiment]
[Investigate]
[Observe]</p>

<hr />

<h1>It's the same with spies</h1>

<p>[Respond]
[Investigate]
[Detect]</p>

<hr />

<h1>And with selling</h1>

<p>[Close the deal]
[Ask questions]
[Research the customer]</p>

<hr />

<p>If we don't understand the situation, why do we jump to conclusions?</p>

<hr />

<h1>Three types of learning</h1>

<p>[Experiment]
[Investigate]
[Observe]</p>

<hr />

<h1>For new businesses</h1>

<p>[Right product?]
[Right customer needs?]
[Right customer?]</p>

<hr />

<h2>I thought I had the answers.</h2>

<hr />

<h1>Your customers words are gold.</h1>

<p>They help you get the right
* sales pitch</p>

<p>--
* product</p>

<p>--
* customer</p>

<hr />

<h1>I had the wrong product because I had the wrong customer</h1>

<p>[Right product?]
[Right customer needs?]
[Right customer?]</p>

<hr />

<p>Running ahead without understanding the customer is like shooting blind.</p>

<hr />

<h1>How do we make sure our arrows are on target?</h1>

<hr />

<h1>How do we learn what really matters to our customers from the start?</h1>

<hr />

<h1>You focus on getting the facts.</h1>

<p>Hard facts are like landmarks. You know where you are so you can decide where to go.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Actionable questions</h1>

<p>give you <strong>facts</strong> you can <strong>act on</strong>.</p>

<p>They give you an <strong>understanding</strong> of the customer that allows you to <strong>respond</strong> with the right product.</p>

<hr />

<h1>3 Rules for actionable questions</h1>

<hr />

<h1>Past</h1>

<p>Not future, because nobody can predict the future.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Fact</h1>

<p>Not opinions, because opinions change.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Specific</h1>

<p>Not general, because generalities hide the opportunities to help.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Actionable questions</h1>

<ul>
<li>Past </li>
<li>Fact</li>
<li>Specific</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h1>Talk about their life, not your idea</h1>

<p>[Right product?]
[Right customer needs?]
[Right customer?]</p>

<hr />

<h1>Talk about their life, not your idea</h1>

<p>[Experiment]
[[Investigate]]
[[Observe]]</p>

<hr />

<h1>Conversation starter questions</h1>

<p>get them talking about <em>a goal in their life</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Tell me about how you..."</p>

<p>"How is it going with..."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>--</p>

<h2><strong>Tip</strong>: if they're not interested in talking to you about that topic, that's good information. It tells you to try something else.</h2>

<hr />

<h1>To understand customers, ask about their life using</h1>

<ol>
<li>Conversation starters - build momentum, get them talking!</li>
<li>Actionable questions - direct the conversation to actionable facts</li>
</ol>

<p>--</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: there's no script.  This is <em>exploration.</em></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Example</strong> You are doing customer research on the market for regional/local food products.</p>

<p>You are interviewing a supermarket manager.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Easing in to the conversation:</h1>

<p>Hey, how are you doing? </p>

<p>Do you have a minute to help me?  I'm a student reseaching how food retailers introduce new products.</p>

<hr />

<h1>.good[Actionable] question or .bad[bad] question?</h1>

<hr />

<h2># Can you please tell me about the last time you introduced a new product. Where did it start?</h2>

<h1>.good[Can you please tell me about the last time you introduced a new product. Where did it start?]</h1>

<p>.profile[<img src="images/grocerymanager.png" alt="" title="" />]
"We hear about new products from head office.  We usually get around 2 or 3 months notice before we start selling them."</p>

<hr />

<h1>Does this happen frequently?</h1>

<hr />

<h1>.bad[Does this happen frequently?]</h1>

<p>.profile[<img src="images/grocerymanager.png" alt="" title="" />]
"Not really."</p>

<hr />

<p>What are the 3 rules for actionable questions?</p>

<hr />

<h1>.bad[Does this happen frequently?]</h1>

<p>Let's fix it and try again.</p>

<hr />

<h1>When does this pop up?</h1>

<hr />

<h1>.bad[When does this problem pop up?]</h1>

<p>.profile[<img src="images/grocerymanager.png" alt="" title="" />]
"Not too often."</p>

<h2>It’s still too general: we want the specifics!</h2>

<hr />

<h1>When was the last time this went off track?</h1>

<hr />

<h1>.good[When was the last time this went off track?]</h1>

<p>.profile[<img src="images/grocerymanager.png" alt="" title="" />]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One of our customers wanted to visit to the farmers, but couldn’t locate them, and we weren’t able to help them either to locate them.”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Great stuff, you found a problem!</p>

<h2>Go deeper!</h2>

<h1>How do you deal with this problem?</h1>

<hr />

<h1>.bad[How do you deal with this problem?]</h1>

<p>.profile[<img src="images/grocerymanager.png" alt="" title="" />]</p>

<p>"We don't."</p>

<p>Oh no!  Let's fix this question and try again.</p>

<hr />

<h1>How did you deal with this last time?</h1>

<hr />

<h1>.good[How did you deal with this last time?]</h1>

<p>.profile[<img src="images/grocerymanager.png" alt="" title="" />]</p>

<p>"I requested some farmer information from our distributors, and started a little binder."</p>

<p>See what asking for specifics can reveal?</p>

<hr />

<p>Now we're learning!</p>

<p>Knowing what they tried tells us how they see the problem, and what it's worth to them.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Can you show me how you did it?</h1>

<hr />

<h1>.good[Can you show me how you did it?]</h1>

<p>.profile[<img src="images/grocerymanager.png" alt="" title="" />]
"Here it is.  You can see, I visited some of the farms myself and took some pictures.</p>

<p>Oh, here's an interesting point. Some customers were asking about what the animals eat, so I have a picture of their troughs."</p>

<hr />

<h1>.good[Can you show me how you did it?]</h1>

<p>Showing is almost always better than telling.</p>

<p>There's a lot more to learn when you can see it.</p>

<p>[Experiment]
[Investigate]
[[Observe]]</p>

<hr />

<h1>Why did you go to the farm?</h1>

<hr />

<h1>.good[Why did you go to the farm?]</h1>

<p>Good question.  Asking why puts you in the mindset of the learner and helps you understand.</p>

<p>Think like an apprentice!</p>

<hr />

<h1>.good[Why did you go to the farm?]</h1>

<p>.profile[<img src="images/grocerymanager.png" alt="" title="" />]
"Well, a year ago, we had a problem with one of our suppliers. They couldn't deliver and that affected our reputation.  So I like to know more about our suppliers and farmers."</p>

<hr />

<h1>How much would you pay for a solution to know all that information?</h1>

<hr />

<h1>.bad[How much would you pay for a solution to know all that information?]</h1>

<p>Opinion and future!  Make this question give you actionable facts.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p><em>Hint</em>: what we really want to know is what is it worth. Ask about <em>their life!</em></p>

<hr />

<h1>How much did this cost you?</h1>

<hr />

<h1>.good[ How much did this cost you?]</h1>

<p>.profile[<img src="images/grocerymanager.png" alt="" title="" />]
“Word got out about our mistake, and sales dropped considerably for the next few weeks.”</p>

<hr />

<h1>.good[ How much did this cost you?]</h1>

<p>Now, we don't know the price of our product, but we have a better sense of what it's worth to them.</p>

<hr />

<p>If you’re in the mindset of a learner, trying to understand the customer, you’re doing great!</p>

<hr />

<h1>Conversation is a skill</h1>

<h2>You have to know the right questions, and you have to know how to listen.</h2>

<h1>Signals</h1>

<p>If you're looking for the right opportunity to help a customer, learn to hear these signals.</p>

<hr />

<p>.profile[<img src="images/obstacle.png" alt="" title="" />]</p>

<h1>Obstacles</h1>

<p>Problems and friction indicate areas where 
we can help. </p>

<hr />

<p>.profile[<img src="images/goal.png" alt="" title="" />]</p>

<h1>Goals</h1>

<p>Tell us where we fit in the bigger picture of their life. Their goals always exist first, before they consider any product.</p>

<p>Listen for -ly words. The same goal done <em>quickly</em> or <em>cheaply</em> will need different solutions.</p>

<hr />

<p>.profile[<img src="images/action.png" alt="" title="" />]</p>

<h1>Actions</h1>

<p>Give us a sense of if they care enough to do something, and if so, what their options are.</p>

<hr />

<hr />

<h1>Three types of learning</h1>

<p>[Experiment]
[[Investigate]]
[[Observe]]</p>

<hr />

<h1>Recording what you hear</h1>

<p>Record <em>exact words</em> and <em>organise by signals.</em></p>

<p>That way, we can spot patterns later.</p>

<hr />

<h2>For each conversation, fill in a page with the signals you hear, like this. Grab a blank sheet and set yourself up.</h2>

<h2>.timer[30 seconds]</h2>

<p>Let's try it. I'll interview a volunteer about their travel, and point the signals I hear.</p>

<p>Write 2-3 key words per signal. Aim for 2 signals per minute.</p>

<h1>Build a better TV</h1>

<h2>Pretend you're competing with Samsung to make the best TV.  What features can you think of?</h2>

<hr />

<h1>Build a better TV for a specific customer group.</h1>

<ol>
<li>In teams, design a TV. Draw it!</li>
<li>You will have a specific customer group.</li>
<li><em>Each group only gets 1 feature!</em></li>
</ol>

<p>.timer[5 minutes]</p>

<p>???</p>

<p>Customer groups: army soldiers, in the boardroom, African farmers, old retired couples, desert nomads, Hong Kong school children, American mothers, scientists</p>

<hr />

<h1>Let's take a minute each to present our concepts</h1>

<h2>.timer[1 minute]</h2>

<h1>How many teams came up with a better feature idea than before?</h1>

<hr />

<h1>Your advantage is speed.</h1>

<p>More features means more complexity, more support. Features make you <strong>slower.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h1>Finding good fits</h1>

<p>Product / Market Fit is about <em>matching</em> the right customer and the right product.</p>

<hr />

<hr />

<h1>Experiments</h1>

<ul>
<li>Will they find it?</li>
<li>Will they buy it?</li>
<li>Will they use it?</li>
<li>Will it work for them?</li>
<li>Will they recommend it?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h1>They prototype</h1>

<hr />

<h1>Entrepreneurs speed up prototypes by <em>isolating</em> the part they want to test.</h1>

<hr />

<h1>Isolate the question!</h1>

<p>Attach it to other parts of the business that we know work.</p>

<h1>Take risks you can afford.</h1>

<p>Minimise the amount of time, money and effort you're risking to run this experiment.</p>
