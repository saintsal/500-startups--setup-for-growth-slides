## Your decisions are only as good as your information


When you wait too long to launch, you only learn a bit and by then it's too late.


---

# Launch fast and improve in cycles

When you launch the fastest thing you can, again and again, you learn what's important and have more time to try again.

---

# Optimise for fast decisions

--

When we're wrong, we'll also correct quickly.

---

A man wakes up,

turns on the radio,

walks upstairs,

turns on the light, 

and kills himself.

## Why?
---

To learn faster and better, it helps to know *what type* of learning you're doing.

---
# Three types of learning

[Experiment]
[Investigate]
[Observe]

---

# The same with Science

[Experiment]
[Investigate]
[Observe]


---

# It's the same with spies

[Respond]
[Investigate]
[Detect]

# And with selling

[Close the deal]
[Ask questions]
[Research the customer]


---
If we don't understand the situation, why do we jump to conclusions?


---
# Three types of learning

[Experiment]

---

# For new businesses

[Right product?]
[Right customer needs?]
[Right customer?]


---

## I thought I had the answers.


---


# Your customers words are gold.

They help you get the right
* sales pitch

--
* product

--
* customer



---
# I had the wrong product because I had the wrong customer

[Right product?]
[Right customer needs?]
[Right customer?]

---


Running ahead without understanding the customer is like shooting blind.


---

# How do we make sure our arrows are on target?

---


# How do we learn what really matters to our customers from the start?

---

# You focus on getting the facts.
Hard facts are like landmarks. You know where you are so you can decide where to go.

---

#Actionable questions
give you **facts** you can **act on**.

They give you an **understanding** of the customer that allows you to **respond** with the right product.

---

# 3 Rules for actionable questions

---


#Past
Not future, because nobody can predict the future.

---


#Fact
Not opinions, because opinions change.

---

#Specific
Not general, because generalities hide the opportunities to help.

---

#Actionable questions

* Past 
* Fact
* Specific

---


# Talk about their life, not your idea

[Right product?]
[Right customer needs?]
[Right customer?]


---


# Talk about their life, not your idea

[Experiment]
[[Investigate]]
[[Observe]]


---


# Conversation starter questions
get them talking about *a goal in their life*

> "Tell me about how you..."

> "How is it going with..."

--

## **Tip**: if they're not interested in talking to you about that topic, that's good information. It tells you to try something else.

---


# To understand customers, ask about their life using

1. Conversation starters - build momentum, get them talking!
1. Actionable questions - direct the conversation to actionable facts

--

**Note**: there's no script.  This is _exploration._

---


**Example** You are doing customer research on the market for regional/local food products.

You are interviewing a supermarket manager.

---


# Easing in to the conversation:
Hey, how are you doing? 

Do you have a minute to help me?  I'm a student reseaching how food retailers introduce new products.


---

# .good[Actionable] question or .bad[bad] question?

---
# Can you please tell me about the last time you introduced a new product. Where did it start?
---
#.good[Can you please tell me about the last time you introduced a new product. Where did it start?]

.profile[![](images/grocerymanager.png)]
"We hear about new products from head office.  We usually get around 2 or 3 months notice before we start selling them."

---

# Does this happen frequently?

---

#.bad[Does this happen frequently?]

.profile[![](images/grocerymanager.png)]
"Not really."

---

What are the 3 rules for actionable questions?

---

#.bad[Does this happen frequently?]

Let's fix it and try again.

---

# When does this pop up?

---

#.bad[When does this problem pop up?]
.profile[![](images/grocerymanager.png)]
"Not too often."


## It’s still too general: we want the specifics!

---

# When was the last time this went off track?

---

# .good[When was the last time this went off track?]

.profile[![](images/grocerymanager.png)]
> “One of our customers wanted to visit to the farmers, but couldn’t locate them, and we weren’t able to help them either to locate them.”


---


Great stuff, you found a problem!

Go deeper!
---


# How do you deal with this problem?

---

# .bad[How do you deal with this problem?]
.profile[![](images/grocerymanager.png)]

"We don't."

Oh no!  Let's fix this question and try again.

---

# How did you deal with this last time?

---

# .good[How did you deal with this last time?]
.profile[![](images/grocerymanager.png)]

"I requested some farmer information from our distributors, and started a little binder."

See what asking for specifics can reveal?

---


Now we're learning!

Knowing what they tried tells us how they see the problem, and what it's worth to them.

---

# Can you show me how you did it?

---

# .good[Can you show me how you did it?]

.profile[![](images/grocerymanager.png)]
"Here it is.  You can see, I visited some of the farms myself and took some pictures.

Oh, here's an interesting point. Some customers were asking about what the animals eat, so I have a picture of their troughs."

---
# .good[Can you show me how you did it?]

Showing is almost always better than telling.

There's a lot more to learn when you can see it.

[Experiment]
[Investigate]
[[Observe]]


---

# Why did you go to the farm?

---

# .good[Why did you go to the farm?]

Good question.  Asking why puts you in the mindset of the learner and helps you understand.

Think like an apprentice!

---

# .good[Why did you go to the farm?]

.profile[![](images/grocerymanager.png)]
"Well, a year ago, we had a problem with one of our suppliers. They couldn't deliver and that affected our reputation.  So I like to know more about our suppliers and farmers."

---

# How much would you pay for a solution to know all that information?

---

# .bad[How much would you pay for a solution to know all that information?]

Opinion and future!  Make this question give you actionable facts.

--

*Hint*: what we really want to know is what is it worth. Ask about *their life!*

---

# How much did this cost you?

---

#.good[ How much did this cost you?]

.profile[![](images/grocerymanager.png)]
“Word got out about our mistake, and sales dropped considerably for the next few weeks.”


---

#.good[ How much did this cost you?]

Now, we don't know the price of our product, but we have a better sense of what it's worth to them.

---


If you’re in the mindset of a learner, trying to understand the customer, you’re doing great!

# Conversation is a skill

You have to know the right questions, and you have to know how to listen.
---

#Signals
If you're looking for the right opportunity to help a customer, learn to hear these signals.


---


.profile[![](images/obstacle.png)]
#Obstacles

Problems and friction indicate areas where 
we can help. 

---


.profile[![](images/goal.png)]
# Goals 
Tell us where we fit in the bigger picture of their life. Their goals always exist first, before they consider any product.

Listen for -ly words. The same goal done _quickly_ or _cheaply_ will need different solutions.

---

.profile[![](images/action.png)]
#Actions 
Give us a sense of if they care enough to do something, and if so, what their options are.

---



---


# Three types of learning

[Experiment]
[[Investigate]]
[[Observe]]


---
# Recording what you hear

Record *exact words* and *organise by signals.*

That way, we can spot patterns later.

---

## For each conversation, fill in a page with the signals you hear, like this. Grab a blank sheet and set yourself up.


.timer[30 seconds]
---



Let's try it. I'll interview a volunteer about their travel, and point the signals I hear.

Write 2-3 key words per signal. Aim for 2 signals per minute.

# Build a better TV

## Pretend you're competing with Samsung to make the best TV.  What features can you think of?

---

# Build a better TV for a specific customer group.

1. In teams, design a TV. Draw it!
1. You will have a specific customer group.
1. *Each group only gets 1 feature!*

.timer[5 minutes]

???

Customer groups: army soldiers, in the boardroom, African farmers, old retired couples, desert nomads, Hong Kong school children, American mothers, scientists

---

# Let's take a minute each to present our concepts

.timer[1 minute]
---

# How many teams came up with a better feature idea than before?

---

# Your advantage is speed.

More features means more complexity, more support. Features make you **slower.**

---

# Finding good fits

Product / Market Fit is about *matching* the right customer and the right product.

# Experiments

- Will they find it?
- Will they buy it?
- Will they use it?
- Will it work for them?
- Will they recommend it?

# How do architects get a building right with one try?

---

# They prototype

# Isolate the question!
Attach it to other parts of the business that we know work.

# Take risks you can afford.

Minimise the amount of time, money and effort you're risking to run this experiment.

---
#Buy information cheaply

When you run an experiment, you're paying for information.  How can you make sure that information is as affordable as possible?

---
name: experiments-checklist

[
* Isolate a single question: will they ---- it? without getting complicated.
* Answer that question as _quickly_ as possible.
* Have a clear measurement
]

---

# Will they find it?

"I want to build an online store to sell marble sculptures."

## What would you do? What would your experiment be?

---
# See how many people search for marble sculptures for sale

---

# See how many people search for marble sculptures for sale

[
* Focuses on the question? [Yes, Will they _find it_ on Google.]
* Minimal amount of time? [Takes 5-10 minutes]
* Clear measurement? [Number of people searching every month]
]

---

##[Reminder!] The faster you learn, the better!

---

# Will they buy it?

"I have an idea for a pizza restaurant with new kinds of pizza."

## What would you do? What would you test and how?


---
### Market stall. A few weeks of effort and you change your menu as you go. 

---

## Market stall
[
* Focuses on the question of buying by putting it in an obvious place - a lunch market
* Takes a few weeks
* Measures the number of people who choose different new pizza toppings
]

---

# Will they buy it?

You can also:

* Sell a simpler version
* If it's a product idea, sell your the service version for the same price
* If it's a large sale to an big organisation , ask them to pre-pay

---

# Will it work for them?

"I have a much better way for business people to buy flights. It's a website with a special timeline to show how tired each flight will make you."

## What would you do? How can you test the part that makes this unique?

---
## Design the screens and ask people to try


???
They even found a name for it from their customers - agony!
---

## Paper prototype
[
* Focuses on the unique part - the user interface
* Takes a a day or so
* Measures the number of people who understood, **and the number of people who actually booked!**
]


---
# Will this increase Average Revenue Per User?

"A VIP area in the store in our chat network will make us more money."

## What would you do? How can you test the part that makes this unique?

---
# Roll it out to a test group

???
Turns out people spent more even if they didn't go into the VIP area.

---
## Cohort Analysis
[
* Focuses on the unique part - the VIP area
* A day to a week
* Measures the difference in ARPU

---
# Increase growth

"My growth is steady, but I can't increase it no matter how I advertise."

## What would you do? How can you test the part that makes this unique?

---
# Ask customers about their life


---
## 
[
* Focuses on the unique part - the customers buying decision
* About a week
* Measures the increase in ad conversion
]

---

A customer wakes up,

logs into a service they've used every day for year, and love,

and they don't renew.

## Why?

---
# Stop losing customers

"Customers are unsuscribing and we're not sure why."

## What would you do? How can you test the part that makes this unique?

---
# Talk to everyone who's quitting
